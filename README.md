# A-Video-Streaming-System-With-Dash.js-base-on-BBA-rule
This project is a video streaming system using BBA rules based on DASH.js. Users can upload their own video files to the server where they will be chopped into segments of about 3 seconds each before generating the related mpd file automatically. Then the player will load and play the mpd file, which implements BBA rules to streaming adaptation according to A buffer-based approach to rate adaptation: evidence from a large video streaming service.
